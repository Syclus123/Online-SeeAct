Experts say it's relatively easy to reduce in some sectors\n\n0 of 1 minute, 52 secondsVolume 0%\n\u00a0\n\nMethane emissions, a key driver of climate change, remain stubbornly high around the world according to an annual update from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nThat's despite the fact that the technology to cut those emissions exists now \u2014 especially for emissions from the oil and gas sector.\n\n\"Because methane is such a potent greenhouse gas, reductions are critical for action on climate,\" said Tom\u00e1s Bredariol, energy and environmental policy analyst at the IEA who worked on the Global Methane Tracker report.\n\nSEE ALSO: How methane emissions threaten climate goals\n\nMethane is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat, but only lasts for around a decade in the atmosphere. Its concentration in the atmosphere has more than doubled in the past two centuries, mostly due to human activities.\n\nAccording to new numbers from the Global Methane Tracker released Wednesday, methane emissions from fossil fuel production have remained at about 120 million tonnes annually since 2019, when they reached a high, and don't seem to be coming down despite global methane pledges.\n\n(International Energy Agency, Global Methane Tracker 2025 (CBC))\n\nContent continues below\n\nThe benefits of methane reductions would be relatively swift and are sorely needed for a quickly warming planet, experts from the intergovernmental agency said.\n\nSmall but significant reductions\n\n\"If we look at current trends and fossil fuel supply, strong action on methane could deliver a reduction of 0.1 C in the rise in global temperatures by 2050,\" said the IEA's Bredariol.\n\nThat might seem small, but it is a significant reduction \u2014 equivalent to eliminating all carbon emissions from heavy industry (steel, iron, chemical manufacturing, etc.) worldwide.\n\nDespite this, the report says countries are still far behind implementing policies to reduce methane.\n\nOnly about five per cent of global oil and gas production meets net-zero methane emissions standards, according to the agency.\n\nMethane emissions projections for the fossil fuel sector under different scenarios. (International Energy Agency, Global Methane Tracker 2025 (CBC)\n\nContent continues below\n\nCanada, however, was singled out as \"a leading jurisdiction\" in tackling methane, according to Janetta McKenzie, director of the oil and gas program at the Pembina Institute.\n\n\"If Canada is leading on reducing oil and gas methane \u2026 there is a net benefit to our economy as well,\" she said. \"We're early innovators in technology and expertise that puts us in a position to sell solutions to the world.\"\n\nCanada has extensive methane regulations for the oil and gas sector, and ambitious targets \u2014 a 75 per cent decrease below 2012 levels by 2030. This is more ambitious than the Global Methane Pledge, which was launched in 2021 and includes Canada along with major emitters like the U.S. and Europe, where countries have promised to cut emissions 30 per cent below 2020 levels by 2030.\n\nMcKenzie said Canada currently has draft methane regulations to drive further reductions until 2030, and Ottawa should act to finalize those rules for the country to continue making progress.\n\nFixing leaks\n\nAgriculture is the biggest source of anthropogenic \u2014 or human-caused \u2014 methane emissions, followed by fossil fuels. But the latter is considered to be the easiest to cut down.\n\n\"There's no need for technological breakthroughs to deliver this,\" Bredariol said. \"Around 70 per cent of methane emissions from the energy sector can be reduced with technologies that have been deployed in multiple places around the world very successfully.\"\n\nContent continues below\n\n(Getty Images/Francesco Scatena/1500037052-170667a)\n\nMethane emissions happen mainly through leaks at oil and gas production facilities, pipelines and terminals, and other energy infrastructure. Technology to reduce those emissions involves plugging leaks in pipes, valves, tanks and other equipment at these facilities.\n\nBut it can be a challenge to find those leaks, since methane is a colourless, odourless gas.

Experts say it's relatively easy to reduce in some sectors\\n\\n0 of 1 minute, 52 secondsVolume 0%\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nMethane emissions, a key driver of climate change, remain stubbornly high around the world according to an annual update from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\\n\\nThat's despite the fact that the technology to cut those emissions exists now \\u2014 especially for emissions from the oil and gas sector.\\n\\n\\\"Because methane is such a potent greenhouse gas, reductions are critical for action on climate,\\\" said Tom\\u00e1s Bredariol, energy and environmental policy analyst at the IEA who worked on the Global Methane Tracker report.\\n\\nSEE ALSO: How methane emissions threaten climate goals\\n\\nMethane is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat, but only lasts for around a decade in the atmosphere. Its concentration in the atmosphere has more than doubled in the past two centuries, mostly due to human activities.\\n\\nAccording to new numbers from the Global Methane Tracker released Wednesday, methane emissions from fossil fuel production have remained at about 120 million tonnes annually since 2019, when they reached a high, and don't seem to be coming down despite global methane pledges.\\n\\n(International Energy Agency, Global Methane Tracker 2025 (CBC))\\n\\nContent continues below\\n\\nThe benefits of methane reductions would be relatively swift and are sorely needed for a quickly warming planet, experts from the intergovernmental agency said.\\n\\nSmall but significant reductions\\n\\n\\\"If we look at current trends and fossil fuel supply, strong action on methane could deliver a reduction of 0.1 C in the rise in global temperatures by 2050,\\\" said the IEA's Bredariol.\\n\\nThat might seem small, but it is a significant reduction \\u2014 equivalent to eliminating all carbon emissions from heavy industry (steel, iron, chemical manufacturing, etc.) worldwide.\\n\\nDespite this, the report says countries are still far behind implementing policies to reduce methane.\\n\\nOnly about five per cent of global oil and gas production meets net-zero methane emissions standards, according to the agency.\\n\\nMethane emissions projections for the fossil fuel sector under different scenarios. (International Energy Agency, Global Methane Tracker 2025 (CBC)\\n\\nContent continues below\\n\\nCanada, however, was singled out as \\\"a leading jurisdiction\\\" in tackling methane, according to Janetta McKenzie, director of the oil and gas program at the Pembina Institute.\\n\\n\\\"If Canada is leading on reducing oil and gas methane \\u2026 there is a net benefit to our economy as well,\\\" she said. \\\"We're early innovators in technology and expertise that puts us in a position to sell solutions to the world.\\\"\\n\\nCanada has extensive methane regulations for the oil and gas sector, and ambitious targets \\u2014 a 75 per cent decrease below 2012 levels by 2030. This is more ambitious than the Global Methane Pledge, which was launched in 2021 and includes Canada along with major emitters like the U.S. and Europe, where countries have promised to cut emissions 30 per cent below 2020 levels by 2030.\\n\\nMcKenzie said Canada currently has draft methane regulations to drive further reductions until 2030, and Ottawa should act to finalize those rules for the country to continue making progress.\\n\\nFixing leaks\\n\\nAgriculture is the biggest source of anthropogenic \\u2014 or human-caused \\u2014 methane emissions, followed by fossil fuels. But the latter is considered to be the easiest to cut down.\\n\\n\\\"There's no need for technological breakthroughs to deliver this,\\\" Bredariol said. \\\"Around 70 per cent of methane emissions from the energy sector can be reduced with technologies that have been deployed in multiple places around the world very successfully.\\\"\\n\\nContent continues below\\n\\n(Getty Images/Francesco Scatena/1500037052-170667a)\\n\\nMethane emissions happen mainly through leaks at oil and gas production facilities, pipelines and terminals, and other energy infrastructure. Technology to reduce those emissions involves plugging leaks in pipes, valves, tanks and other equipment at these facilities.\\n\\nBut it can be a challenge to find those leaks, since methane is a colourless, odourless gas. The IEA says that actual methane emissions worldwide are about 80 per cent higher than what's reported by countries in their annual greenhouse gas emissions reports.\\n\\nResearch over the past decade has helped zoom in to where the leaks are happening, some of which is now being used by the IEA for the methane tracking.\\n\\nThe agency relied on data from satellites, including GHGSat, which is operated out of Montreal, to come up with better estimates of methane emissions around the world.

For example, a vision system might be connected to a planner that might in turn provide commands to a low-level controller that drives the robot's motors. In this talk, I will discuss how ideas from deep learning can allow us to build robotic control mechanisms that combine both perception and control into a single system. This system can then be trained end-to-end on the task at hand. I will show how this end-to-end approach actually simplifies the perception and control problems, by allowing the perception and control mechanisms to adapt to one another and to the task. I will also present some recent work on scaling up deep robotic learning on a cluster consisting of multiple robotic arms, and demonstrate results for learning grasping strategies that involve continuous feedback and hand-eye coordination using deep convolutional neural networks.\n\nBIO: Sergey Levine is an assistant professor at the University of Washington. His research focuses on robotics and machine learning. In his PhD thesis, he developed a novel guided policy search algorithm for learning complex neural network control policies, which was later applied to enable a range of robotic tasks, including end-to-end training of policies for perception and control. He has also developed algorithms for learning from demonstration, inverse reinforcement learning, efficient training of stochastic neural networks, computer vision, and data-driven character animation.\n\nChris Dyer\n\nShould Model Architecture Reflect Linguistic Structure?\n\nSequential recurrent neural networks (RNNs) over finite alphabets are remarkably effective models of natural language. RNNs now obtain language modeling results that substantially improve over long-standing state-of-the-art baselines, as well as in various conditional language modeling tasks such as machine translation, image caption generation, and dialogue generation. Despite these impressive results, such models are a priori inappropriate models of language. One point of criticism is that language users create and understand new words all the time, challenging the finite vocabulary assumption. A second is that relationships among words are computed in terms of latent nested structures rather than sequential surface order (Chomsky, 1957; Everaert, Huybregts, Chomsky, Berwick, and Bolhuis, 2015).\n\nIn this talk I discuss two models that explore the hypothesis that more (a priori) appropriate models of language will lead to better performance on real-world language processing tasks. The first composes sub word units (bytes, characters, or morphemes) into lexical representations, enabling more naturalistic interpretation and generation of novel word forms. The second, which we call recurrent neural network grammars (RNNGs), is a new generative model of sentences that explicitly models nested, hierarchical relationships among words and phrases. RNNGs operate via a recursive syntactic process reminiscent of probabilistic context-free grammar generation, but decisions are parameterized using RNNs that condition on the entire (top-down, left-to-right) syntactic derivation history, greatly relaxing context-free independence assumptions. Experimental results show that RNNGs obtain better results in generating language than models that don\u2019t exploit linguistic structures.\n\nBIO: Chris Dyer is an assistant professor in the Language Technologies Institute and Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. He obtained his PhD in Linguistics at the University of Maryland under Philip Resnik in 2010. His work has been nominated for\u2014and occasionally received\u2014best paper awards at EMNLP, NAACL, and ACL.\n\nAnima Anandkumar\n\nGuaranteed Non-convex Learning Algorithms through Tensor Factorization\n\nModern machine learning involves massive datasets of text, images, videos, biological data, and so on. Most learning tasks can be framed as optimization problems which turn out to be non-convex and NP-hard to solve. This hardness barrier can be overcome by: (i) focusing on conditions which make learning tractable, (ii) replacing the given optimization objective with better behaved ones, and (iii) exploiting non-obvious connections that abound in learning problems.\n\nI will discuss the above in the context of: (i) unsupervised learning of latent variable models and (ii) training multi-layer neural networks, through a novel framework involving spectral decomposition of moment matrices and tensors. Tensors are rich structures that can encode higher order relationships in data. Despite being non-convex, tensor decomposition can be solved optimally using simple iterative algorithms under mild conditions. In practice, tensor methods yield enormous gains both in running times and learning accuracy over traditional methods for training probabilistic models such as variational inference. These positive results demonstrate that many challenging learning tasks can be solved efficiently, both in theory and in practice.\n\nBIO: Anima Anandkumar is a faculty at the EECS Dept. at U.C.Irvine since August 2010.

She received her B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras in 2004 and her PhD from Cornell University in 2009. She was a postdoctoral researcher at MIT from 2009 to 2010, and a visiting faculty at Microsoft Research New England in 2012 and 2014. Anima\n\nNeil Lawrence\n\nBeyond Backpropagation: Uncertainty Propagation\n\nDeep learning is founded on composable functions that are structured to capture regularities in data and can have their parameters optimized by backpropagation (differentiation via the chain rule). Their recent success is founded on the increased availability of data and computational power. However, they are not very data efficient. In low data regimes parameters are not well determined and severe overfitting can occur. The solution is to explicitly handle the indeterminacy by converting it to parameter uncertainty and propagating it through the model. Uncertainty propagation is more involved than backpropagation because it involves convolving the composite functions with probability distributions and integration is more challenging than differentiation.\n\nWe will present one approach to fitting such models using Gaussian processes. The resulting models perform very well in both supervised and unsupervised learning on small data sets. The remaining challenge is to scale the algorithms to much larger data.\n\nBIO: Neil Lawrence is Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Sheffield. His expertise is in probabilistic modelling with a particular focus on Gaussian processes and a strong interest in bridging the worlds of mechanistic and empirical models.\n\nRaquel Urtasun\n\nTitle: Incorporating Structure in Deep Learning\n\nDeep learning algorithms attempt to model high-level abstractions of the data using architectures composed of multiple non-linear transformations. A multiplicity of variants have been proposed and shown to be extremely successful in a wide variety of applications including computer vision, speech recognition as well as natural language processing. In this talk I\u2019ll show how to make these representations more powerful by exploiting structure in the outputs, the loss function as well as in the learned embeddings.\n\nMany problems in real-world applications involve predicting several random variables that are statistically related. Graphical models have been typically employed to represent and exploit the output dependencies. However, most current learning algorithms assume that the models are log linear in the parameters. In the first part of the talk I\u2019ll show a variety of algorithms that can learn arbitrary functions while exploiting the output dependencies, unifying deep learning and graphical models.\n\nSupervised training of deep neural nets typically relies on minimizing cross-entropy. However, in many domains, we are interested in performing well on metrics specific to the application domain. In the second part of the talk I\u2019ll show a direct loss minimization approach to train deep neural networks, which provably minimizes the task loss. This is often non-trivial, since these loss functions are neither smooth nor decomposable and thus are not amenable to optimization with standard gradient-based methods. I\u2019ll demonstrate the applicability of this general framework in the context of maximizing average precession, a structured loss commonly used to evaluate ranking problems.\n\nDeep learning has become a very popular approach to learn word, sentence and/or image embeddings. Neural embeddings have shown great performance in tasks such as image captioning, machine translation and paraphrasing. In the last part of my talk I\u2019ll show how to exploit the partial order structure of the visual semantic hierarchy over words, sentences and images to learn order embeddings. I\u2019ll demonstrate the utility of these new representations for hypernym prediction and image-caption retrieval.\n\nBIO: Raquel Urtasun is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto and a Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

The author who will be giving the talk must find the oral session chair in advance, to test the use of his/her personal laptop for presenting the slides.\n\nTalks scheduled before the morning coffee break should do a laptop test before the morning session starts, while other talks can perform their tests during the coffee break.\n\nPoster Presentations\n\nThe poster boards are 4 ft. high by 8 ft. wide. Poster presenters are encouraged to put up their posters as early as the day's morning coffee break (10:20 to 10:50).\n\nEach poster is assigned a number, shown above. Presenters should use the poster board corresponding to the number for their work.\n\nOnce the poster session is over, presenters have until the end of the day to take off their posters from their assigned poster boards.",

For example, a vision system might be connected to a planner that might in turn provide commands to a low-level controller that drives the robot's motors. In this talk, I will discuss how ideas from deep learning can allow us to build robotic control mechanisms that combine both perception and control into a single system. This system can then be trained end-to-end on the task at hand. I will show how this end-to-end approach actually simplifies the perception and control problems, by allowing the perception and control mechanisms to adapt to one another and to the task. I will also present some recent work on scaling up deep robotic learning on a cluster consisting of multiple robotic arms, and demonstrate results for learning grasping strategies that involve continuous feedback and hand-eye coordination using deep convolutional neural networks.\\n\\nBIO: Sergey Levine is an assistant professor at the University of Washington. His research focuses on robotics and machine learning. In his PhD thesis, he developed a novel guided policy search algorithm for learning complex neural network control policies, which was later applied to enable a range of robotic tasks, including end-to-end training of policies for perception and control. He has also developed algorithms for learning from demonstration, inverse reinforcement learning, efficient training of stochastic neural networks, computer vision, and data-driven character animation.\\n\\nChris Dyer\\n\\nShould Model Architecture Reflect Linguistic Structure?\\n\\nSequential recurrent neural networks (RNNs) over finite alphabets are remarkably effective models of natural language. RNNs now obtain language modeling results that substantially improve over long-standing state-of-the-art baselines, as well as in various conditional language modeling tasks such as machine translation, image caption generation, and dialogue generation. Despite these impressive results, such models are a priori inappropriate models of language. One point of criticism is that language users create and understand new words all the time, challenging the finite vocabulary assumption. A second is that relationships among words are computed in terms of latent nested structures rather than sequential surface order (Chomsky, 1957; Everaert, Huybregts, Chomsky, Berwick, and Bolhuis, 2015).\\n\\nIn this talk I discuss two models that explore the hypothesis that more (a priori) appropriate models of language will lead to better performance on real-world language processing tasks. The first composes sub word units (bytes, characters, or morphemes) into lexical representations, enabling more naturalistic interpretation and generation of novel word forms. The second, which we call recurrent neural network grammars (RNNGs), is a new generative model of sentences that explicitly models nested, hierarchical relationships among words and phrases. RNNGs operate via a recursive syntactic process reminiscent of probabilistic context-free grammar generation, but decisions are parameterized using RNNs that condition on the entire (top-down, left-to-right) syntactic derivation history, greatly relaxing context-free independence assumptions. Experimental results show that RNNGs obtain better results in generating language than models that don\\u2019t exploit linguistic structures.\\n\\nBIO: Chris Dyer is an assistant professor in the Language Technologies Institute and Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. He obtained his PhD in Linguistics at the University of Maryland under Philip Resnik in 2010. His work has been nominated for\\u2014and occasionally received\\u2014best paper awards at EMNLP, NAACL, and ACL.\\n\\nAnima Anandkumar\\n\\nGuaranteed Non-convex Learning Algorithms through Tensor Factorization\\n\\nModern machine learning involves massive datasets of text, images, videos, biological data, and so on. Most learning tasks can be framed as optimization problems which turn out to be non-convex and NP-hard to solve. This hardness barrier can be overcome by: (i) focusing on conditions which make learning tractable, (ii) replacing the given optimization objective with better behaved ones, and (iii) exploiting non-obvious connections that abound in learning problems.\\n\\nI will discuss the above in the context of: (i) unsupervised learning of latent variable models and (ii) training multi-layer neural networks, through a novel framework involving spectral decomposition of moment matrices and tensors. Tensors are rich structures that can encode higher order relationships in data. Despite being non-convex, tensor decomposition can be solved optimally using simple iterative algorithms under mild conditions. In practice, tensor methods yield enormous gains both in running times and learning accuracy over traditional methods for training probabilistic models such as variational inference. These positive results demonstrate that many challenging learning tasks can be solved efficiently, both in theory and in practice.\\n\\nBIO: Anima Anandkumar is a faculty at the EECS Dept. at U.C.Irvine since August 2010. Her research interests are in the areas of large-scale machine learning, non-convex optimization and high-dimensional statistics. In particular, she has been spearheading the development and analysis of tensor algorithms for a variety of learning problems. She is the recipient of the Alfred. P. Sloan Fellowship, Microsoft Faculty Fellowship, Google research award, ARO and AFOSR Young Investigator Awards, NSF CAREER Award, Early Career Excellence in Research Award at UCI, Best Thesis Award from the ACM SIGMETRICS society, IBM Fran Allen PhD fellowship, and best paper awards from the ACM SIGMETRICS and IEEE Signal Processing societies.

Anima\\n\\nNeil Lawrence\\n\\nBeyond Backpropagation: Uncertainty Propagation\\n\\nDeep learning is founded on composable functions that are structured to capture regularities in data and can have their parameters optimized by backpropagation (differentiation via the chain rule). Their recent success is founded on the increased availability of data and computational power. However, they are not very data efficient. In low data regimes parameters are not well determined and severe overfitting can occur. The solution is to explicitly handle the indeterminacy by converting it to parameter uncertainty and propagating it through the model. Uncertainty propagation is more involved than backpropagation because it involves convolving the composite functions with probability distributions and integration is more challenging than differentiation.\\n\\nWe will present one approach to fitting such models using Gaussian processes. The resulting models perform very well in both supervised and unsupervised learning on small data sets. The remaining challenge is to scale the algorithms to much larger data.\\n\\nBIO: Neil Lawrence is Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Sheffield. His expertise is in probabilistic modelling with a particular focus on Gaussian processes and a strong interest in bridging the worlds of mechanistic and empirical models.\\n\\nRaquel Urtasun\\n\\nTitle: Incorporating Structure in Deep Learning\\n\\nDeep learning algorithms attempt to model high-level abstractions of the data using architectures composed of multiple non-linear transformations. A multiplicity of variants have been proposed and shown to be extremely successful in a wide variety of applications including computer vision, speech recognition as well as natural language processing. In this talk I\\u2019ll show how to make these representations more powerful by exploiting structure in the outputs, the loss function as well as in the learned embeddings.\\n\\nMany problems in real-world applications involve predicting several random variables that are statistically related. Graphical models have been typically employed to represent and exploit the output dependencies. However, most current learning algorithms assume that the models are log linear in the parameters. In the first part of the talk I\\u2019ll show a variety of algorithms that can learn arbitrary functions while exploiting the output dependencies, unifying deep learning and graphical models.\\n\\nSupervised training of deep neural nets typically relies on minimizing cross-entropy. However, in many domains, we are interested in performing well on metrics specific to the application domain. In the second part of the talk I\\u2019ll show a direct loss minimization approach to train deep neural networks, which provably minimizes the task loss. This is often non-trivial, since these loss functions are neither smooth nor decomposable and thus are not amenable to optimization with standard gradient-based methods. I\\u2019ll demonstrate the applicability of this general framework in the context of maximizing average precession, a structured loss commonly used to evaluate ranking problems.\\n\\nDeep learning has become a very popular approach to learn word, sentence and/or image embeddings. Neural embeddings have shown great performance in tasks such as image captioning, machine translation and paraphrasing. In the last part of my talk I\\u2019ll show how to exploit the partial order structure of the visual semantic hierarchy over words, sentences and images to learn order embeddings. I\\u2019ll demonstrate the utility of these new representations for hypernym prediction and image-caption retrieval.\\n\\nBIO: Raquel Urtasun is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto and a Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
